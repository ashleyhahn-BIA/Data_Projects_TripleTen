# Project 1: Manhattan Vacation Rental Market Analysis

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to help a client evaluate investment opportunities in the Manhattan vacation rental market. Using Airbnb listing and booking data, I provided recommendations on which **neighborhoods** and **property sizes** (i.e., number of bedrooms) were the most attractive for short-term rentals, based on rental popularity and potential revenue.

The project involved cleaning raw datasets, performing pivot table analysis, creating visualizations, and estimating annual revenue for top-performing listings. Key assumptions, such as using the number of reviews in the last 12 months (`number_of_reviews_ltm`) as a proxy for rental frequency, were documented to ensure a transparent analytical process.

## Business Questions Answered
- Which neighborhoods in Manhattan are most attractive for vacation rentals?
- Which property sizes (number of bedrooms) are most popular for short-term rentals?
- Do different neighborhoods prefer different property sizes?
- How much potential annual revenue could top listings generate?

## Key Tasks and Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Standardized inconsistent neighborhood names (`neighborhood_clean` column).
  - Reclassified empty bedroom values as studio apartments (`bedrooms_clean` column).
- **Analysis**:
  - Built pivot tables to identify the top 10 neighborhoods based on review counts.
  - Analyzed the popularity of different property sizes across neighborhoods.
  - Filtered listings to focus on the most attractive property type per neighborhood.
- **Revenue Estimation**:
  - Created a `revenue_earned` column in the calendar dataset by identifying available nights and corresponding nightly prices.
  - Aggregated 30-day revenue and extrapolated to estimate annual revenue for top listings.
  - Identified the highest-earning listing based on total revenue earned.
- **Visualization**:
  - Produced a bar chart showing the number of reviews for the top 10 neighborhoods.

- **Harlem** showed a particular preference for 1-bedroom properties.
- The highest-earning listing (ID: `5525510`) had the potential to generate substantial annual income based on the observed revenue.
