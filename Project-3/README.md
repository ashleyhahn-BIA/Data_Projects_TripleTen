# 💻 Project 3: E-Commerce Business Conversion Funnel Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview  
As a Junior Data Analyst at an e-commerce company, I was tasked with analyzing raw user activity logs to derive critical business metrics. The project focused on building a **conversion funnel** to measure the site's ability to turn page views into purchases and preparing **cohort analyses** to track user retention over time.

The analysis required data cleaning, pivot table creation, formula building, and professional spreadsheet structuring to deliver executive-level insights.
