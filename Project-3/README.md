# Project 3: E-Commerce Business Conversion Funnel Analysis

## Project Overview
As a Junior Data Analyst at an e-commerce company, I was tasked with analyzing raw user activity logs to derive critical business metrics. The project focused on building a **conversion funnel** to measure the site's ability to turn page views into purchases and preparing **cohort analyses** to track user retention over time.

The analysis required data cleaning, pivot table creation, formula building, and professional spreadsheet structuring to deliver executive-level insights.

## Business Questions Answered
- How efficiently does the website convert visitors into paying customers?
- What is the overall user retention rate by monthly acquisition cohort?
- How do user behaviors change over time from their initial purchase?

## Key Tasks and Methodology
- **Conversion Funnel Analysis**:
  - Created a three-step funnel tracking unique users across product page views, cart openings, and completed purchases.
  - Calculated total and step-by-step conversion rates.
- **Cohort Analysis Preparation**:
  - Isolated purchase activities from raw event data.
  - Calculated each user's first purchase date using VLOOKUP and pivot tables.
  - Generated monthly event and acquisition cohorts using the TEXT and DATEDIF functions.
- **Cohort Retention Rates**:
  - Aggregated users by acquisition month and tracked user retention across 1-4 month periods.
  - Created a retention matrix with percentage retention rates month-over-month.
- **Executive Summary and Documentation**:
  - Wrote a clear executive summary of results and documented all assumptions about the data.
  - Organized sheets into a logical structure with a table of contents for easy navigation.
  - Formatted spreadsheets for professional readability (bold headers, frozen rows, borders, clean number/date formatting).

## Key Findings
- **Conversion Funnel**:
  - Identified the major drop-offs between product page views and purchases.
  - Provided recommendations for improving the cart-to-purchase conversion stage.
- **User Retention**:
  - Early months showed stronger retention, with significant drop-offs by month 3 and 4.
  - Retention patterns indicated opportunities for re-engagement marketing in later months.

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets (Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP, TEXT, DATEDIF, SUMIF functions)
- Advanced spreadsheet formatting and dashboard organization

## Deliverables
- Executive Summary with key results and data assumptions
