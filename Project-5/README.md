# Project 5: Root Cause Analysis of Returned Orders

## Project Overview
This project explores the root causes of returned orders at the Superstore. As a data analyst, my goal was to help the CEO understand **what is driving high return rates** and how to **reduce the volume and impact of returns** across key products, customers, and regions. I conducted return rate analysis using Tableau and designed an interactive dashboard to support ongoing monitoring and decision-making.

## Key Business Questions
- What types of products are being returned most frequently?
- Are return rates linked to specific customers or customer behaviors?
- Are certain regions or time periods more prone to returns?
- How do returns correlate with total sales or profitability?
- What composite trends point to deeper root causes?
-

### 📊 Return Metrics Preparation
- Merged `Returns` table to `Orders` table using a **LEFT JOIN**.
- Created a calculated field `Returned_flag`:
  - `1` if order was returned
  - `0` if not
- Used this field to calculate:
  - **Return Rate** (average of `Returned_flag`)
  - **Total Returns** (sum)
  - **Return Cost Impact** (optional insight)

## Worksheets Created

### 1. Correlation Between Sales and Returns
- **Scatterplot** by Product Subcategory
- Shows whether higher sales correlate with higher returns

### 2. Return Rate by Product Category
- **Bar chart** ranking each category by average return rate

### 3. Customer-Level Return Rate
- Filtered to show only customers with more than one order
- Identifies individuals prone to excessive returns

### 4. Return Rate by Geography
- **Map visualization** showing return concentrations by state

### 5. Return Rate by Time
- **Line chart** showing monthly return trends
- Highlights possible seasonal effects

### 6. Composite Charts (x2)
- Mixed views (e.g., return rate by month AND category)
- Designed to surface hidden multi-variable patterns

## 📖 Tableau Story Presentation

### 🧭 Story Arc
- Defined return rate vs. return count vs. return cost
- Identified key trends and root causes
- Walked through dashboard filters and use cases
- Proposed actions (e.g., product delisting, customer review, regional training)

### 💡 Business Recommendations
- Flag high-risk customers for review or policy changes
- Remove or repackage high-return subcategories
- Launch targeted return reduction efforts in problem states
- Use dashboard for quarterly monitoring and decision-making

## Tools Used
- Tableau (Data joins, calculations, dashboarding, storytelling)
- Excel (Data cleanup and JOIN prep)

## Outcome
This project delivered a repeatable method to identify, track, and act on return risks across the business. It gives Superstore leadership the tools needed to reduce return-related losses and improve customer experience.
