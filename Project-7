# Project 7: Customer Segmentation and Retention Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This final capstone project explores customer behavior using a fictional food delivery dataset. The objective was to segment customers by age, geography, and frequency of orders to identify key trends in repeat purchases and overall retention.

## 📊 Data Sources
The dataset (`customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `regions.csv`) includes:
- Customer demographics and regions
- Order dates, frequency, and revenue
- Regional population and urban vs. rural tags

## ❓ Business Questions
- Which age group generates the most revenue?
- Which regions have the highest repeat order rates?
- Are specific days or product categories tied to higher engagement?

## 🔧 Key Techniques Used
- Power BI DAX for cohort analysis
- Custom calculated columns for repeat rate
- Slicers and filters for dynamic exploration

## 📷 Visual Output
- Monthly Order Volume by Region
- Age Group Revenue Comparison
- Repeat Order Rate by Geography

## 💡 Key Insights
- Customers aged 25–34 were the most loyal and generated the highest LTV.
- Urban regions had higher engagement than rural areas, especially on weekends.
- Cohort analysis revealed a drop-off after month 2, suggesting a loyalty incentive opportunity.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI (Cohort Modeling, DAX, Visuals)
- Excel (Preprocessing)

## ✅ Outcome
This final project showcases the ability to segment customer behavior and generate business insights to support marketing and retention strategies.
