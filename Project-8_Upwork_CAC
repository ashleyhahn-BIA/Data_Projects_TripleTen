- Dashboard-style summary pages
- Month-to-month comparisons with executive insights

## 📷 Visual Output
- Monthly CAC by Platform
- Executive Summary Page
- Channel Comparison Table

## 💡 Key Insights
- Meta had a lower average CAC but more fluctuation month-to-month
- Google Ads delivered more consistent CAC, ideal for budget stability
- Targeted CAC remained higher due to fixed costs; blended CAC improved with higher volume
